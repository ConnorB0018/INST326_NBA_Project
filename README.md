> Swar's nba_api is an API package that extracts various up-to-date basketball (NBA) box score stats, ranging from a franchise's amount of NBA finals appearance to a listing of NBA players that shoot 90 percent from the 3pt line, from the NBA.com website. With the main goal of the program being to provide users (NBA fans) access to an in-depth analysis of different NBA matches (without the hassle of reading or sighting complex box score layouts), the use of static and endpoint functions within the API helped extract the essential NBA insights and stats needed to produce the information for the program.
